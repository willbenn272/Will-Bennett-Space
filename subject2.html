<h2>Info on the Start of the Web</h2>
<p>The first website was launched on August 6, 1991, by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. It was
    hosted on a NeXT computer at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and served as an informational page
    explaining the basic concepts of the web and how to use it. The website's address was http://info.cern.ch. At the
    time, the World Wide Web was still a new idea, and there were very few users. As for the early internet browsers,
    the first one was WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus), which was also created by Berners-Lee. Other early browsers
    that helped popularize the web included Mosaic, released in 1993, which was the first browser to display images
    alongside text, and Netscape Navigator, which became one of the most widely used browsers during the 1990s. These
    early browsers laid the foundation for the rapid growth of the internet, which would soon transform how people
    accessed and shared information globally.

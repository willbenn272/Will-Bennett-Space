      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <p>This website explores the development of the World Wide Web, tracing its journey from its groundbreaking
        invention by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to the dynamic and interconnected modern internet we know today. It delves
        into the origins of the web at CERN, its foundational technologies like HTML and HTTP, and its transformation
        through the eras of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. Along the way, it highlights key innovations, milestones, and
        the ongoing evolution of how people share, access, and interact with information online.</p>

      <h2>Key Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - HTTP is the protocol that allows your browser to communicate with a web
          server to request web pages, images, videos, or any other content. When you enter a URL into your browser, it
          sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested content. It’s a stateless protocol,
          meaning each request is independent and doesn’t retain user information between requests. The secure version
          of HTTP is called HTTPS, which encrypts the data for privacy and security.</li>
        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - HTML provides the basic building blocks of web pages. It uses a system of
          tags (like h1, p, a, div, etc.) to define the structure and type of content — such as headings,
            paragraphs, links, images, and tables. When a browser reads an HTML file, it renders the content accordingly
            , allowing users to view and interact with web pages. HTML is not a programming language; it's a markup
            language designed to organize content.</li>
        <li>Web Browser</li>

    Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist best known for inventing the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 while
    working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). He proposed an information management system that
    eventually became the Web, enabling the creation of websites, hyperlinks, and web browsers as we know them today.

  <h2>Key Facts about Tim Berners-Lee:</h2>
  <h3>Invention of the World Wide Web:</h3>
<p>
    In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a way to link documents across different computers using hypertext. This idea
    evolved into the World Wide Web, which revolutionized how information is shared and accessed globally.
    His invention made use of several technologies, including HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol), and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
</p>

<p>
Impact:
    The creation of the World Wide Web made the internet accessible to millions of people worldwide, enabling the
    development of websites, online businesses, social media, and more.
    Without Berners-Lee's vision, the internet might not have become the interactive, hyperlinked, and multimedia-rich
    tool that it is today.
</p>

<p>
Further Contributions:
    Berners-Lee also founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, an organization that works to develop open
    standards and protocols to ensure the web remains accessible, interoperable, and inclusive for all users.
    He is a strong advocate for internet freedom, privacy, and open data, and has continued to promote the idea that the
    web should be a universal platform available to all people, regardless of background or location.
</p>

<p>
Awards and Recognition:
    Tim Berners-Lee has received numerous accolades and awards for his work, including being knighted by Queen Elizabeth
    II in 2004 for his contribution to the development of the World Wide Web.
</p>
  <h3>Current Role:</h3>
<p>

As of today, Berners-Lee continues to advocate for the open web and is involved in several projects related to improving the web, including the Solid project, which aims to give individuals control over their personal data.
In short, Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web has transformed nearly every aspect of modern life, making him one of the most influential figures in the digital age.
